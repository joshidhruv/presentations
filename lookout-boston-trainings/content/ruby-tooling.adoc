== Rubies

== MRI

Also known as "Matz's Ruby Interpreter"

The reference implementation of the Ruby language

* **Pros**
** Fast startup time
** Most commonly targeted by library developers
** Native code interface for C ABI interop. (aka native extensions)
** Packages on most OSes
* **Cons**
** Global VM Lock
*** **One** system thread executing Ruby code at once
*** Concurrent, but not parallel
** Native extensions mean C code in ruby gems


== Rubinius

Ruby VM and runtime implemented primarily with Ruby

* **Pros**
** Fast startup time
** Easy debuggability of runtime, "it's just Ruby"
** No Global VM Lock; concurrent and parallel
* **Cons**
** Poor adoption/support in broader Ruby community
** Political disputes between Rubinius and other VM implementers resulting in
   potential language spec divergeance.

== JRuby

Tyler's favorite Ruby implementation, Ruby implemented on top of the Java Virtual Machine

* **Pros**
** Full interop with code from any other JVM-based language (Scala, Clojure, Groovy, Java)
** Performance increases in JVM execution speed apply to JRuby
** No Global VM Lock; concurrent and parallel
** Supported by corporate sponsorship (Redhat)
** Ruby language features supported on a longer timeframe (e.g. MRI 1.9.3 EoL Feb 2015, JRuby 1.9.3 not yet EoL)
* **Cons**
** Slow startup time due to JVM startup time + Ruby interpretation
** Incompatibilities with MRI-specific gems with native extensions
** Generally lags behind reference Ruby language implementation
** Poor "Ruby native" debugger support


== Ruby Ecosystem Basics

== Rubygems

* link:http://rubygems.org[rubygems.org]: Community supported repository of publicly reusable Ruby gems (libraries)
* Uses a custom repository format and APIs
* Most Ruby tools (e.g. `gem` CLI) default to interfacing with `rubygems.org`

== RVM

Ruby version manager.

* Enormous set of bash scripts for installing and using Ruby versions in and
  out of a unix shell environment
* Modifies `GEM_HOME`, `GEM_PATH` and `PATH` environment variables
* Wraps a number of common commands (e`g` `gem`, `bundle`)
* Supports "gemsets" for isolating different installations of Rubygems


== Bundler

* Most commonly used dependency management tool
* Supports:
**  "groups" of gem dependency enumerations
** Version ranges (`"~> 0.3.1"`) and pinning (`Gemfile.lock`)
** `bundle gem` command generates a conventional Ruby gem project structure


== Rake

* Most commonly used task management tool
* Many gems (e.g. `bundler` or `rspec`) provide Rake tasks for common functions
  (e.g. "packaging a gem")


== Travis CI

* Open-source Continuous Integration service
* Used outside of Ruby ecosystem as well


== JRuby Ecosystem Addons

=== jbundler

* Extension onto Bundler for resolving JVM-centric dependencies (e.g.
  Maven-based dependencies)
* Similar to `Gemfile.lock` generates `Jarfile.lock` with pinned versions
* Defaults to accessing jars from link:http://central.maven.org[Maven Central]
* Authored by link:https://github.com/mkristian[Christian Meier]

=== jar-dependencies

* Gem for expressing JVM-centric dependencies for a Ruby gem
* Solves the problem of expressing non-Ruby gem transitive dependencies
* "Just works" with jbundler and JRuby/Gradle (e.g.
  link:https://github.com/lookout/hermann[Hermann] gem)
* Authored by link:https://github.com/mkristian[Christian Meier]

=== warbler

* Ruby gem for building a `.war` or `.jar` from Ruby sources
* Implicit integration with Bundler
* Auto-detects project type based on `.gemspec` or `config.ru` presence

== JRuby/Gradle

* Toolchain for unifying Ruby/Java task and dependency management via Gradle
* Supports expressing Ruby gem and JVM-centric dependencies in one place
* Builds on top of existing Gradle plugins/infrastructure
* Makes usage of bundler/rake/rvm/warbler/jbundler in a JRuby project
  unnecessary


== Ruby Web Frameworks

=== Sinatra

Bare-bones "routes" DSL and request routing API on top of Rack

=== Rails

Everything and the kitchen sink.

* Originally designed for making building CRUD applications easy
* Deeply opinionated MVC design, much "just works" by a "convention over
  configuration" philosophy


== Ruby Web Servers

=== Rack

Implementation of a common Ruby web server interface. Closely related to "WSGI"
from the Python ecosystem.

* Supports "middleware" for injecting code into request/response path
* Supported by every Ruby-based webserver in use
* link:https://github.com/jruby/jruby-rack[jruby-rack] project binds Rack
  interface into the Java Servlet Container interface

=== Puma

Multi-threaded Rack server supporting MRI/JRuby

* High performance/tunable
* Embeddable

=== Unicorn

Single-threaded Rack server primarily targeting MRI

* Relies on commonly implemented "multi process" parallelism model in MRI
* In heavy use at GitHub

=== Passenger

Multi-process multi-threaded non-Rack and Rack compatible server.

* Commonly deployed with Apache or Nginx


== Ruby Test Tooling

=== RSpec

Expressive testing DSL

* Primarily used for unit-level testing, but adaptable to more
  feature/acceptance oriented testing
* Supports:
** user defined extensions to DSL ("custom matchers")
** Assertion reusability ("shared examples")

=== Cucumber

"Behavior Driven Development" testing tool, generally used in conjunction with
RSpec for describing behaviors in user-story like "features"

* Gherkin syntax ("Given/When/Then") ported to Java and JavaScript
* Suggest "product owner readable" features as a communication mechanism for
  requirements of an application
* Very useful for generation customer facing (e.g. REST) API documentation

=== Test::Unit

Unit testing library, defaulted in Rails. Follows more traditional xUnit
interface/model


== Ruby Debugging

* link:http://pryrb.com[Pry] - immensely useful REPL
* Use the debugger! (1.8.7 => `ruby-debug`, 1.9.x => `debugger`, 2.x =>
  `byebug`)

== Documentation

* `rvm docs generate all` and `ri` command line tool

----
âžœ  ~  ri Array.pop
= Array.pop

(from ruby site)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  ary.pop    -> obj or nil
  ary.pop(n) -> new_ary

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Removes the last element from self and returns it, or nil if the array is
empty.

If a number n is given, returns an array of the last n elements (or less) just
like array.slice!(-n, n) does. See also Array#push for the opposite effect.

  a = [ "a", "b", "c", "d" ]
  a.pop     #=> "d"
  a.pop(2)  #=> ["b", "c"]
  a         #=> ["a"]
