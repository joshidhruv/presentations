== Presented By

=== Open Source Work

[%step]
* Founded link::http://jruby-gradle.org[JRuby/Gradle] project
// Based on picnic-table discussions at JRuby Conf EU in 2014, seeing some of the
// problems that other developers, myself included, had with building more
// complex Java and Ruby hybrid applications, I started hacking on a Gradle
// plugin the week after the conference

=== Professional Work

image::lookout-icon.png[Lookout, Inc]

// 4 1/2 years at Lookout developing primarily in Ruby. I've shipped production
// code in Ruby, C and Groovy while at Lookout.
//
// Prior to that over 4 years of work with Python.


// Before we get into the JRuby side of things, let's talk about the problem at
// hand

== The Problem

There's a lot more to Java and Ruby integration than `require 'some.jar'`

//The problem that many developers run into when they start to get in deep with
//JRuby is: I can integration Java and Ruby code! Great! I want to do that in a
//real project!

=== More Specifically

[%step]
* Native Java dpeendency resolution
// I have a jar that dependends on two jars, which each depend on three other
// jars, I guess I'll just copy everything into my git tree!
* Cross-ecosystem dependencies
// I have a gem that depends on some Java library being installed, how does that
// even work?
* Cross-ecosystem builds
// I've got some custom Java code that I wrote, that I want to use in my Ruby
// project. How the hell does this work?

== Previous Approaches

[%step]
* Shell out to `$BUILD_TOOL`
// I've seen lots of projectskkshell out from Rake to another build tool, like
// Maven, in order to fetch some Java dependencies that the build needs. This is
// problematic for two reasons, one being that your dependencies are declared in
// two places with no clear interaction between the two. Secondly, Rake as a
// task-execution tool, has no internal notion of dependencies needed for any
// particular tasks
//
// In the case of a project like redstorm, previously it used Ivy and Ant for
// the Java side of the house, and then Bundler and Rake for the Ruby side.
* link::https://github.com/mkristian/ruby-maven[Ruby Maven]
// I'm not terribly familiar with Ruby Maven, it's one of the many tools that
// Christian Meier has built to help address the problems inherent in making Ruby
// and Java ecosystems play way together
* link::https://github.com/mkristian/jbundler[jbundler]
// Another tool from Christian, one which I've personally had the most previous
// success with. jbundler builds on top of bundler to provide Java-based dependency
// management and resolution for native Java dependencies. underneath the hood it
// does use Maven for this, but from the user viewpoint that's merely an
// implementation detail


// So what's interesting/special about Gradle?

== Intro to Gradle

Gradle is a multilanguage build tool native to the JVM.

[%step]
* Manages:
** code dependencies
** buildscript dependencies
** task dependencies
* self-describing

// It's
// comparable to Maven but where it succeeds and Maven tends to fall short is in
// easy extensibility.
//
// One of the more compelling, but not immediately noticed, features of Gradle is
// that it allows for self-describing build files. In effect, I can implement my
// build files to enumerate the dependencies that the build file needs to execute!
//
// Aside from a JDK, there should almost never be unspecified dependencies or
// configuration outside of a Gradle file.

== Motivation


[quote, Me]
____
I'm tired of hacking together a bunch of so-so tools.
____

=== Important features

[%step]
* Java (`.jar`) and Ruby (`.gem`) dependency management
* Dependency and task management integration
// I don't want to have one big flat list of dependencies that have to be installed
// before I can do any work whatsoever. If running some task requires a dependency,
// then it should be fetched/installed when I need that dependency
* Extendable
* Easy to manage and publish extensions

==== Nice to haves

* Self-contained
// Being able to self-contain as much as possible in the source tree makes the
// burden of ramping up on the project that much smaller. Asking a casual
// contributor to install RVM, then compile a specific version of Ruby just to test
// a patch locally is a pretty big hurdle
* Ecosystem of tools already present
// While not strictly a requirement, it's always nice to choose a tool that has
// lots of existing integrations and other extension points. In the case of
// Gradle there's already plenty of IDE integrations and a very rich plugin
// community already present


== JRuby/Gradle

[quote, Me]
____
The best thing.
____


// The week after JRuby Conf EU 2014, I started the jruby-gradle tooling in
// response to some picnic table conversations with Colin Surprenant who had been
// using a combination of ant, ivy, bundler and rake to accomplish tasks in his
// Java/Ruby project. I've seen people use all sorts of mismashes of tools to
// manage their JRuby projects, and used many of them myself. They've almost all
// been barely supported, uncomfortable hacks.


== Base

=== Features

* Fundamental Ruby dependency management
* `JRubyExec` task definition
* `GeneratedGradleRb` task definition

== Jar

* Support creation of:
** Library-type JRuby jars
** Self-contained executable jars
*** With default entry point: `java -jar my.jar -S irb`
*** With custom entry point: `java -jar my.jar --custom-opts=foo`

== War

NOTE: Still experimental

* Prepare a JRuby-based `.war` archive for deployment into servlet containers

== Storm

* Prepare an link:http://storm.apache.org[Apache Storm] topology `.jar`
* `JRubyStormLocal` task for local topology

== Test

NOTE: Still in development

* Expose Ruby test tools via Gradle
** `rspec { }` DSL
** `cucumber { }` DSL

== Rake

NOTE: Still Experimental

* Expose and proxy  Rake tasks thorugh the Gradle task interface


== Neat

== This presentation


== External system requirements


* Java

----
% git clone git://github.com/rtyler/presentations.git
% cd presentations/jruby-gradle-java-powertools
% ./gradlew
----

== Using a Gradle plugin or two

[source,gradle]
----
include::../build.gradle[lines=1..15]
----

== Depending on Ruby gems


[source, gradle]
----
include::../build.gradle[lines=35..37]
----
<1> Declaring a Ruby gem dependency


== Tying it together

[source, gradle]
----
include::../build.gradle[lines=57..86]
----
<1> Task dependencies
<2> Invoking a custom backend, with Ruby!

== Demo!

[%step]
* I want to write Ruby code
* And Ruby tests
* And Java code
* And I want to ues Ruby gems
* And I want to use Java jars
* And I want to still like writing code at the end of it


== Granular dependency management

[source, gradle]
----

configurations {
    rspec
}

dependencies {
    gems 'rubygems:haml:4.0.6'

    rspec 'rubygems:rspec:2.99.0'
}
----

== Resolving Gem dependencies


Gradle doesn't support the Ruby gem repositoriy format *yet*, so the only way to
get dependency resolution is to use a format that Gradle already understands.
Maven!

[source,xml]
----
include::maven-metadata.xml[lines=1..20]
----


== Incorporating Java-based dependencies

(pssst, it's the same)

[source,gradle]
----
dependencies {
    rspec 'org.apache.storm:storm-core:0.9.5'
}
----



== Executing Ruby from Gradle

[source, gradle]
----
include::../example-project/build.gradle[lines=21..31]
----
<1> Express task dependency, only execute after `classes` completes
<2> Use a custom classpath to pull in Java classes
<3> Special execution flag to trigger exec-like behavior (should go away)
<4> Name of the Ruby binscript
<5> Arguments for the Ruby binscript
